#Real-time-face-mask-detector-using-CNN-and-MobileNetV2

 After the breakout of the worldwide pandemic COVID-19, there arose a severe need
 of protection mechanisms, face mask being the primary one. Face mask detection
 is used to identify whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The monitoring
 process of this system involves detecting anyone who is not sporting a face mask.
 The face mask detection model that we proposed, supports machine learning and
 image processing techniques. The planned model is a real time detector of people
 wearing or not wearing a mask. The model is an integration between deep learning
 and classical machine learning techniques with OpenCV, Tensor ow and Keras.
